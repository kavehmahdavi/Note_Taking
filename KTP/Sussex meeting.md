Introduction:

**Digital Agronomy** 

- It is a **==commercial==** & ==innovative== data-driven project to:
- Plant Health Analytics: (Stress)
    
    ==Early Detection:== Identifies stress factors in plants before visible symptoms appear, allowing for timely intervention.
    
    ==Improved Crop Health:== Helps maintain optimal conditions for plant growth, reducing the risk of crop loss due to stress-related issues.
    
    Resource Efficiency: Optimizes resource usage, such as water, nutrients, and energy, leading to reduced costs and environmental impact.
    
    Increased Yield: Minimizes stress-related yield losses, resulting in higher crop production.
    
    Environmental Sustainability: Reduces the need for excess fertilizers and pesticides, contributing to more sustainable farming practices.
    
    Cost Reduction: By preventing or minimizing plant stress, it lowers expenses associated with corrective measures.
    
    ==Data-Driven Decision-Making:== Offers data and insights for informed decision-making, allowing for proactive plant management.
    
    Crop Quality Improvement: Results in higher-quality produce with fewer defects, increasing marketability and profitability.
    
    ==Improved Resilience:== Enhances plants' ability to withstand adverse environmental conditions, such as drought or extreme temperatures.
    
    Scientific Insights: Provides valuable data for research and scientific studies on plant stress and its management
    
    &nbsp;
    
- Plant Development Analytics: (Performance)
    
    ==Data-Driven Growth==: Offers data on temperature conditions and their impact on plant growth, facilitating informed decision-making and adjustments to temperature management.
    
    Year-Round Cultivation: Supports year-round cultivation by simulating the ideal temperature conditions regardless of seasonal variations.
    
    ==Optimized Growth Phases==: Controls temperature exposure to promote specific growth phases, such as germination, flowering, or fruit development.
    
    ==Optimized Growing Conditions:== Provides a better understanding of the temperature conditions that promote plant growth, helping to maintain optimal growing environments.
    
    ==Energy Efficiency==: Allows for precise control of heating and cooling systems, reducing energy consumption and operational costs.
    
    ==Enhanced Crop Yield==: By adjusting temperature patterns, it can lead to increased crop production and higher yields.
    
    ==Crop Quality Improvement:== By controlling temperature, it can result in higher-quality produce with improved taste, appearance, and nutritional value.
    
    Adaptation to Specific Crops: Tailors temperature conditions to the specific needs of different plant varieties, enhancing overall cultivation efficiency.

- By : 
    - Early Detection
    - Anomaly detection and warning
    - Risk  and vulnerability analysis
    - Recommendation system
    - Decision support system
    - And Predictive Planing

&nbsp;

Challenges:

- The Greenhouse Environment as complex ==Mini-Ecosystem==
- The dataset is incomplete, no Year-Round Cultivation data
- Not labelled
- It is an  system is complex and dynamic
