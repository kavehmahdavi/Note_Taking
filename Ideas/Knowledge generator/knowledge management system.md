Scientific inquiry depends on knowledge, but there are many ways in which this knowledge is represented, one of which is the unstructured knowledge source of the scientific literature. Driven by the recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs), knowledge extraction via natural language processing (NLP) will be utilised and this project will automate knowledge extraction, representation and usages via NLP-Knowledge Graph-AI to deliver more human-interpretable outputs to OT users.

We are interested in applications of machine learning to mine the research literature for additional types of entities relevant to pest discovery not already available (such as variants, biomarkers, tissues/cell types, adverse events, and assay conditions). This position provides a real opportunity to make a significant impact on a critical problem in pest discovery for the many users of the GROFAR ecosystem and an opportunity to contribute to the open source models and code associated with biological entities.

Key functions include:

- To find and use suitable pre-trained NLP models from the public domain (e.g., HuggingFace)
- To retrain them on the open scientific literature available in **Europe PMC** to ensure they are optimised for the projectâ€™s need.
- To modernise and extend the current entity recognition workflows to cover an array of additional types of entities relevant to drug discovery
- Apply quantization methods to optimise model performance at production and efficiency, especially when dealing with large datasets.
- Utilise and refine vector embedding techniques to improve the representation of scientific textual data, enhancing the accuracy of entity extraction and relationship mapping.
- Development of new machine learning, deep learning or NLP protocols to enhance curation workflows
- Develop interfaces for deep searching of **Europe PMC,** customised for curator groups
- Collaboration with **EMBL-EBI** curator groups to collect specifications, test prototypes and deliver tools that meet their needs
- Work with the EBI ChEMBL team to develop and utilise statistically robust methods for data analysis and benchmarking
- Collaborate with the OT partners to assess, prioritise, validate and refine the developed methods
- Work closely with the OT core team for the seamless integration of data and workflows into the OT Platform
- Actively disseminate the outcomes of the project to the scientific community and stakeholders through well-crafted presentations and publications
- advanced big data pre-processing, cleaning, and transformation techniques specific to textual data including ontologies
- data visualisation tools to effectively communicate data insights.
