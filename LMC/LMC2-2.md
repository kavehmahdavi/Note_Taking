==**Simeon Report:**==

As a scientist, I am more eager to publish my personal ideas than anyone else.

Furthermore, this project has a greater academic capacity.

But ......

There are some concerns that need to be addressed.

First:

- The publications' MS is in the last 3 or 4 months of the project.

&nbsp;

Second:

- As a Fargro asset, how can I make an academic contribution to the university?
- If I am not mistaken, I am also a member of the university's academic staff.

&nbsp;

To-Do:

- ==To be in the conferences to present the paper and publication.==
- ==The IP is very important. the objective of the Terry.==
